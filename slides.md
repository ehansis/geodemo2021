# Best practices

---

# 🪤🐁

---

## If you want to be a data analysis professional...

* No manual editing of input data
* No interactive data analysis  
* Fully scripted processing, re-process at the push of a button

---
  
## Other people propagating similar ideas:

- [Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG)](https://hrdag.org/2016/06/14/the-task-is-a-quantum-of-workflow/)
- [Richard McElreath, MPI EVA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwRdO9_GGhY)

# Test

---

## Three levels of testing

* `assert` statements
* unit tests
* consistency checks

# Version control

This demo is on [GitHub](https://github.com/ehansis/geodemo2021).

Git is a version control system.

---

### Version control gives you...

* versioned code 🤦‍
* diffing
* merging
* true collaborative work

(... this rules out P💥werBI, T🦄bleau, Ql🚀k, etc.)

---

# Are these ideas new?

---

# No.

Software developers have been working like this for a long time. 
Data people need to catch up.

# Thank you!
